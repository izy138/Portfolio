    longDescription: `FIU Panther Planner is the all-in-one Chrome extension that transforms how college students navigate their academic journey. Simply select your major, and Panther Planner instantly generates a personalized checklist of all required courses, letting you track your progress easily. Our intelligent AI agent analyzes your academic progress and recommends which courses to take next to stay on track, while automatically detecting schedule conflicts to ensure your semester runs smoothly. Build your schedule directly in the extension, and our smart routing feature uses Google Maps to show you the optimal walking path between classes, so you'll never be late again. Plus, stay motivated with real-time tracking of your credits earned and GPA progress toward graduation. FIU Panther Planner turns the chaos of course planning into a streamlined, AI-powered experience that fits right in your browser, because your education deserves better than scattered spreadsheets and guesswork.

• AI Academic Advisor (Roary): Personalized course recommendations and academic guidance
• Smart Schedule Planning: Intelligent course scheduling with conflict detection
• Campus Navigation: Google Maps integration for optimal routes between classes
