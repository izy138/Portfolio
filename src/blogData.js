      title: "Getting Started with WebGPU",
      content: "I saw a twitter post showing a particle life simulation and instantly wanted to try to make my own. The simulation is inspired by @lisyarus simulation found here: https://lisyarus.github.io/webgpu/particle-life.html. The simulation is written using the WebGPU API, and I have had so much fun making it. I started off with a simple verion using vanilla JavaScript, HTML5 Canvas, and CSS. However I realized going about 800+ particle count significantly impacted FPS. This is because it was running at O(nÂ²) time, every particle had to check every other particle, for each frame. A small version of it is what is used on the homepage using only 600 particles.",
